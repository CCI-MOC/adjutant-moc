# Act is a local runner for GitHub actions

-P ubuntu-latest=nektos/act-environments-ubuntu:18.04

# Notes
# There are certain differences between real GitHub and Act
# 1. GITHUB_WORKSPACE is /github/workspace in Act
#                        /home/runner/work in GitHub
# 2. Act will generally allow admin operations without sudo.
